            <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.</p>
            <p>cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.</p>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual "tokens," which are represented by ledger entries internal to the system. </p>
            <p>Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto."</p>
